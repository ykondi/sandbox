Multisnake
==========

Description
-----------

This project is basically to generate and play around with a number
of snakes, in a variation of the traditional 'snake' game.

Firing it up
------------
* python splitter.py
* Hit 'X' to start/pause the system (acts as a toggle)
* Middle mouse button to create a snake. Appears on the top left corner of the scanvas
* W, A, S, D set the direction. Keeping the button held accelerates motion
* Middle mouse generates a new snake
* Scroll to select the snake you want to control. The HUD reflects the one that's selected
* Restricted to six snakes for now. Theoretically, the comp can handle hundreds, but the user can _not_!

Latest Features
---------------
* HUD created
* Selection feature added

To Do
-----
* Make switching control more intuitive
* Add constraints
* Figure out a game to test control
* Possibly chart learning curve

Tools
------
* Python 2.7
